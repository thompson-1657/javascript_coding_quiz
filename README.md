Upon clicking the play button the user will be taken to the game play screen. The quiz will begin with question one out of five. Each question has four possible answers to choose from. The quiz is timed and the time counts down from 1 min 15 sec. This 75 second countdown timer leaves the user about 15 seconds for each question. The score for the user starts at 0 and increments by 1 for every correct answer out of 5. The heads up display on the screen will log which question the user is on, how much time they have left, and what their current score is. Another fun feature is the answer chosen by the user will highlight in green if the user has chosen the correct answer or red if the user has chosen the incorrect answer.

Once the user has answered all of the questions or the time has expired the application will load to an end page. The end page will display the users score from the completed quiz. If the user would like to save their score there is a placeholder to enter their initials. If the user enters their initails and clicks the save button they will be lead back to the home page with an option to either play again or check the highscores by clicking the button. If the user does not want to enter their score they have the options to link back to the home page or immediately play the quiz again.

Lastly, the user has the ability to check the high score page to see where their score falls in comparison to others. The scoreboard will display the top five saved scores. After checking where they fall the user can click the "Go Home" button to go back to the home page.

Designing this application was quite challenging. It incorporated using html, css, and javascript. Through javascript I had to manipulate the DOM to react to user interaction. This application was a good practice in setting up a well rounded, multifunctional application. Many different aspects had to be assesed throughout the process of builing the web page. This will add great value in creating future applications!
